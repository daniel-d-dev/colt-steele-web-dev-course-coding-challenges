# Favorite Movies Exercise
This exercise focuses on practicing the use of ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists in HTML.  The provided HTML file contains some initial markup.  The task is to add to this markup to create two lists: one ordered list of top 3 movies and one unordered list of other good movies.

## Challenge Description

Create the following two lists:

*   **Ordered List (Top 3 Movies):**
    1.  Amadeus
    2.  Stand By Me
    3.  Amelie

*   **Unordered List (Other Good Movies):**
    *   Alien
    *   Parasite
    *   Annie Hall

## Solution

The solution is implemented by adding the appropriate `<ol>` and `<ul>` elements, along with their corresponding `<li>` (list item) elements, to the existing HTML in `index.html`.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

*   HTML Lists (ordered and unordered)
*   HTML List Items

## How to Run

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.  The two movie lists should be displayed correctly, one ordered and one unordered.
