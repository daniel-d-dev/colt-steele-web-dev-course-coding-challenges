# Our First For Loop Practice

This exercise introduces the use of `for` loops in JavaScript. The task is to print a specific string a fixed number of times using a `for` loop.

## Challenge Description

Use a `for` loop to print the string `"Da ba dee da ba daa"` exactly six times to the console.

## Solution

The solution involves creating a `for` loop that iterates six times. Inside the loop, the string `"Da ba dee da ba daa"` is printed to the console using `console.log()`.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

*   JavaScript `for` Loops
*   Loop Counter Initialization, Condition, and Increment/Decrement
*   Loop Body Execution

## How to Run

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (if there is an associated HTML file). You may need to open the browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12) to see the output. If you are using a Node.js environment, you can run `node index.js` from the command line. The `for` loop will execute, and the string `"Da ba dee da ba daa"` will be printed to the console six times.
