# Logical AND Mystery Exercise

I've provided you with a conditional statement that uses a variable called `mystery`  **Please change the value of **`**mystery**` so that the conditional is true and "YOU GOT IT" is printed to the console.  Do not change anything other than the value of `mystery` on line 1!
