# Our First Constants Exercise

This exercise introduces the concept of constants in JavaScript. The task is to define two constants with specific names and values.

## Challenge Description

In `index.js`, define the following two *constants*:

1.  `boilingPointC`: Set this constant equal to the number `100`.
2.  `boilingPointF`: Set this constant equal to the number `212`.

**Important:** Use the `const` keyword to declare these variables, as they are intended to be constants.

## Solution

The solution is implemented in `index.js` by declaring the two constants using the `const` keyword and assigning them the specified numeric values.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

*   JavaScript Constants
*   Constant Declaration (`const`)
*   Constant Assignment
*   Data Types (Numbers)

## How to Run

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (if there is an associated HTML file). You may need to open the browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12) to see the constants if you are not printing them to the console. If you are using a Node.js environment, you can run `node index.js` from the command line. The constants will be declared in the JavaScript environment. You won't see any visible output unless you explicitly print the constant values to the console using `console.log(boilingPointC);` and `console.log(boilingPointF);`.
