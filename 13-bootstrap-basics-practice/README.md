# Bootstrap Basics Practice

This exercise focuses on practicing basic Bootstrap classes. The HTML in `index.html` already includes Bootstrap. The task is to add the appropriate Bootstrap classes to style the elements as specified.

## Challenge Description

Add Bootstrap classes to the HTML elements in `index.html` to achieve the following:

1.  Make the `<section>` element a Bootstrap container.
2.  Style the `<h1>` element:
    *   White text
    *   Dark background
    *   Center-aligned text
3.  Style the `<div>` element:
    *   Alert with "warning" color
    *   Set the `role` attribute to `alert` for accessibility.
4.  Style the first `<button>` element:
    *   Green Bootstrap button
5.  Style the second `<button>` element:
    *   Red Bootstrap button

## Solution

The solution is implemented by adding the appropriate Bootstrap classes to the HTML elements in `index.html`.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

*   Bootstrap Classes:
    *   Containers (`.container`)
    *   Text Styling (`.text-white`, `.text-center`)
    *   Background Colors (`.bg-dark`)
    *   Alerts (`.alert`, `.alert-warning`)
    *   Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-success`, `.btn-danger`)
*   Accessibility (`role="alert"`)

## How to Run

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The elements should be styled according to the added Bootstrap classes.
