# Web Development Exercises

This repository contains a collection of coding exercises completed as part of the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy by Colt Steele.  These exercises cover a wide range of web development concepts, from basic HTML structure and styling to more advanced JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling.  The primary focus is on demonstrating proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Exercises Overview

The exercises are organised into individual folders.  Each folder contains the necessary files for the exercise, which may include an HTML file, a JavaScript file, and a README.  The README for each exercise provides a brief description of the challenge, the key concepts covered, and a description of my approach to solving the problem.

## Key Concepts Covered

The exercises cover the following key concepts:

HTML:
*   **Semantic HTML:**  Using HTML elements for their intended purpose.
*   **HTML Structure:**  Organizing content with headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and forms.
*   **HTML Elements:**  Using specific tags like links, images, labels, inputs, and buttons.
*   **HTML Attributes:**  Adding attributes like `id`, `class`, `for`, `placeholder`, `type`, `action`, and `alt`.
*   **HTML Entities:**  Representing special characters.

CSS:
*   **CSS Selectors:**  Targeting elements using element, class, ID, descendant combinators, and pseudo-classes.
*   **CSS Properties:**  Styling elements with properties like `color`, `background-color`, `text-transform`, etc.
*   **CSS Box Model:**  Understanding the box model for layout.
*   **Linking CSS:**  Connecting CSS to HTML.
*   **Bootstrap Classes:**  Using pre-defined Bootstrap classes for styling and layout.

JavaScript:
*   **JavaScript Variables/Constants:**  Declaring and assigning values to variables and constants.
*   **Data Types:**  Working with numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects.
*   **String Methods:**  Using methods like `trim()`, `toLowerCase()`, `slice()`, and `replace()`.
*   **Template Literals:**  Creating strings with backticks and interpolation.
*   **Conditional Statements:**  Using `if`, `else if`, and `else` for logic.
*   **Logical Operators:**  Using `&&` (AND) operator.
*   **Arrays:**  Working with array literals, indexing, and methods.
*   **Objects:**  Creating and accessing object properties.
*   **Loops:**  Using `for` and `for...of` loops.
*   **Functions:**  Defining and calling functions, including function expressions and arrow functions.
*   **Object Methods:**  Defining functions within objects.
*   **Array Methods:**  Using methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `every()`.
*   **DOM Manipulation:**  Selecting and modifying HTML elements.
*   **Event Handling:**  Responding to events like clicks, form submissions, and input changes.
*   **DOM Selectors:**  Using `getElementById()`, `querySelector()`, and `querySelectorAll()`.
*   **Event Listeners:**  Attaching event listeners using `addEventListener()`.
*   **classList Manipulation:**  Manipulating CSS classes using the `classList` property.

## Running the Exercises

Each exercise is designed to be self-contained and can be run directly in a web browser.  To run an exercise:

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Open the browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12).
3.  Observe the output in the console and/or the changes in the HTML page as described in the exercise's README.
