# More For Loops Practice

This exercise practices writing `for` loops that count down, rather than up. The task is to print a sequence of numbers in descending order using a `for` loop.

## Challenge Description

Write a `for` loop that prints the following numbers to the console, in this specific order: 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 0.

## Solution

The solution involves creating a `for` loop that initializes its counter at 25, decrements by 5 in each iteration, and continues as long as the counter is greater than or equal to 0. Inside the loop, the current value of the counter is printed to the console.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

*   JavaScript `for` Loops
*   Loop Counter Initialization, Condition, and Decrement
*   Loop Body Execution

## How to Run

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (if there is an associated HTML file). You may need to open the browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12) to see the output. If you are using a Node.js environment, you can run `node index.js` from the command line. The `for` loop will execute, and the numbers 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, and 0 will be printed to the console in that order.
