# Lotto Numbers Exercise

This exercise introduces the creation of arrays in JavaScript. The task is to define an array containing six numbers.

## Challenge Description

Define a variable called `lottoNumbers` and set it equal to an array containing any six numbers of your choice.

## Solution

The solution is implemented by declaring the `lottoNumbers` variable and assigning it an array literal containing six numeric values.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

*   JavaScript Arrays
*   Array Literals

## How to Run

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (if there is an associated HTML file). You may need to open the browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12) to see the variables if you are not printing them to the console. If you are using a Node.js environment, you can run `node index.js` from the command line. The `lottoNumbers` array will be created in the JavaScript environment. You won't see any visible output unless you explicitly print the array's contents to the console using `console.log(lottoNumbers);`.
