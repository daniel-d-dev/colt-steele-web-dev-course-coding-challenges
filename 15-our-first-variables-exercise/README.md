# Our First Variables Exercise

This exercise introduces the concept of variables in JavaScript. The task is to define two variables with specific names and values.

## Challenge Description

In `index.js`, define the following two variables:

1.  `myLuckyNumber`: Set this variable equal to the number `37`.
2.  `octopusLimbs`: Set this variable equal to the number `8`.

## Solution

The solution is implemented in `index.js` by declaring the two variables using the `let` keyword (or `const` if the values are not intended to be reassigned) and assigning them the specified numeric values.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

*   JavaScript Variables
*   Variable Declaration (`let`, `const`)
*   Variable Assignment
*   Data Types (Numbers)

## How to Run

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (if there is an associated HTML file).  You may need to open the browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12) to see the variables if you are not printing them to the console. If you are using a Node.js environment, you can run `node index.js` from the command line. The variables will be declared in the JavaScript environment. You won't see any visible output unless you explicitly print the variable values to the console using `console.log(myLuckyNumber);` and `console.log(octopusLimbs);`.
