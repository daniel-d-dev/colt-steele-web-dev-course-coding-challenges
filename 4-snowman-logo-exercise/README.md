# Snowman Logo Exercise

This exercise focuses on practicing the use of HTML entities and superscript text. The task is to create an `<h1>` heading that displays a snowman symbol and the "Snowman Productions®" text, with the registered trademark symbol in superscript.

## Challenge Description

Create an `<h1>` heading that displays the following:

*   A snowman symbol (using the appropriate HTML entity).
*   The text "Snowman Productions".
*   The registered trademark symbol (®) in superscript (using both the HTML entity and the `<sup>` tag).

## Solution

The solution is implemented by using the correct HTML entity for the snowman symbol (`&#9731;`), the text "Snowman Productions", the HTML entity for the registered trademark symbol (`&#174;`), and the `<sup>` tag to make the trademark symbol superscript within the `<h1>` tag in the `index.html` file.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

*   HTML Headings (`<h1>`)
*   HTML Entities (for special characters)
*   Superscript Text (`<sup>`)

## How to Run

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The `<h1>` heading should display the snowman symbol and the "Snowman Productions®" text correctly formatted.
