# Basic Selectors Practice

This exercise focuses on practicing basic CSS selectors. The HTML structure in `index.html` should *not* be modified.  All CSS rules should be written in `app.css`.

## Challenge Description

Write CSS rules in `app.css` to achieve the following:

1.  Set the text color of all `li` elements to `blue`.
2.  Set the text color of all elements with the class `done` to `grey`.
3.  Set the background color of the element with the ID `clear` to `red` and the text color to `white`.

## Solution

The solution is implemented in `app.css`. The CSS rules use element selectors (`li`), class selectors (`.done`), and ID selectors (`#clear`) to target the appropriate elements and apply the specified styles.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

*   CSS Selectors:
    *   Element Selectors (`li`)
    *   Class Selectors (`.done`)
    *   ID Selectors (`#clear`)

## How to Run

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The list items and the button should be styled according to the CSS rules defined in `app.css`.
