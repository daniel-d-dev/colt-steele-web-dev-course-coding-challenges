# Descendant Combinator Practice

This exercise focuses on practicing the CSS descendant combinator. The HTML structure in `index.html` should *not* be modified. All CSS rules should be written in `app.css`.

## Challenge Description

Using the descendant combinator, write CSS rules in `app.css` to achieve the following:

1.  Style only the links (`<a>` elements) within the `header` element:
    *   Font size: `30px`
    *   Color: `teal`

2.  Style only the links within the paragraph element with the ID `dislikes`:
    *   Font weight: `bold`
    *   Color: `red`

## Solution

The solution is implemented in `app.css`. The CSS rules use the descendant combinator (space between selectors) to target the links within the specified parent elements.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

*   CSS Selectors:
    *   Descendant Combinator (e.g., `header a`, `#dislikes a`)

## How to Run

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The links in the header and the links in the "dislikes" paragraph should be styled according to the CSS rules defined in `app.css`.
