# Our First Object Exercise

This exercise introduces the creation of object literals in JavaScript. The task is to define an object with specific properties and values.

## Challenge Description

Define a new variable called `product`. It should be an object literal with the following properties:

*   `name`: Set to the string `"Gummy Bears"`
*   `inStock`: Set to the boolean `true`
*   `price`: Set to the number `1.99`
*   `flavors`: Set to an array of at least three strings (e.g., `["grape", "apple", "cherry"]`)

## Solution

The solution involves creating an object literal and assigning it to the `product` variable.  The object literal contains the specified properties and their corresponding values.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

*   JavaScript Objects
*   Object Literals
*   Object Properties (String, Boolean, Number, Array)

## How to Run

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (if there is an associated HTML file). You may need to open the browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12) to see the variables if you are not printing them to the console. If you are using a Node.js environment, you can run `node index.js` from the command line. The `product` object will be created in the JavaScript environment. You won't see any visible output unless you explicitly print the object's contents to the console using `console.log(product);`. The console should display the object with its properties and values.
