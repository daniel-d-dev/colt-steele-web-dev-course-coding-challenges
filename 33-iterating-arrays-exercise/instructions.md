# Iterating Arrays Exercise

I've provided you with an array of strings called people. Loop over the `people` array with a for loop, **printing out each name in uppercase letters. ** Your result should look something like:

1.  SCOOBY
2.  VELMA
3.  DAPHNE
4.  SHAGGY
5.  FRED

Hint: use `i` from your loop as an array index!
