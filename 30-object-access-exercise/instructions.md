# Object Access Exercise

In index.js, you'll find a `restaurant` object that contains a name, address, city, state, and zipcode. 

-   **Your task to is to create a variable named **`**fullAddress**`** that points to a string** using the information from `restaurant`. 

-   `fullAddress` should point to a string that includes the address, city, state, and zipcode from the restaurant object. Make sure to add any necessary commas or spaces between the values to precisely match the exact expected output format, which is shown in the example below.

-   To make it harder to "cheat" by copy and pasting, I've randomly generated the address portion. For example, if the address was "64 Johnson Ave", the `fullAddress` variable would look like this:

1.  "64 Johnson Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11206"  // this is the expected output format of the fullAddress string (keep an eye on the commas and/or spaces between the values and match that too!)
