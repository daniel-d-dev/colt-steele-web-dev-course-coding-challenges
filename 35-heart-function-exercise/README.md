# Heart Function Exercise

This exercise introduces the creation and execution of a simple function in JavaScript. The task is to define a function that prints a specific string to the console and then call that function.

## Challenge Description

Define a function called `printHeart` that prints the string `"<3"` to the console using `console.log()`.  After defining the function, execute (call) it once.

## Solution

The solution involves defining the `printHeart` function using the `function` keyword and including the `console.log("<3");` statement within the function's body. The function is then called once using `printHeart();`.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

*   JavaScript Functions
*   Function Definition
*   Function Execution/Calling

## How to Run

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (if there is an associated HTML file). You may need to open the browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12) to see the output. If you are using a Node.js environment, you can run `node index.js` from the command line. The `printHeart()` function will be defined and called, and the string `"<3"` will be printed to the console.
