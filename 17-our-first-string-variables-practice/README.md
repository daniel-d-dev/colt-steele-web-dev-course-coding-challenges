# Our First String Variables Practice

This exercise focuses on defining string variables in JavaScript. The task is to create two variables and assign them string values.

## Challenge Description

Define the following two string variables (you can use either `let` or `const`):

1.  `bestColor`: Set this variable to the string `"purple"`.
2.  `quote`: Set this variable to the string `"You had me at \"hello\""`.

## Solution

The solution is implemented in `index.js` by declaring the variables and assigning them the specified string values.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

*   JavaScript String Variables
*   String Declaration (`let`, `const`)
*   String Assignment

## How to Run

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (if there is an associated HTML file). You may need to open the browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12) to see the variables if you are not printing them to the console. If you are using a Node.js environment, you can run `node index.js` from the command line. The variables will be declared in the JavaScript environment. You won't see any visible output unless you explicitly print the variable values to the console using `console.log(bestColor);` and `console.log(quote);`.
