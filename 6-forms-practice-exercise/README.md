# Forms Practice Exercise

This exercise focuses on practicing the use of HTML forms, input elements, labels, and buttons. The task is to create a simple form with specific input fields and a submit button.

## Challenge Description

Create a form with the following inputs:

1.  **Username:**
    *   Text input (`<input type="text">`)
    *   Placeholder text: "username"
    *   Proper label (using `id` and `for` attributes)

2.  **Password:**
    *   Password input (`<input type="password">`)
    *   Placeholder text: "password"
    *   Proper label (using `id` and `for` attributes)

3.  **Button:**
    *   Button element (`<button>`)
    *   Inner text: "Register"

The form's `action` attribute can be set to a placeholder like "tacos.com" or any other value.  The key is to correctly use the form elements and attributes.

## Solution

The solution is implemented by adding the appropriate HTML form elements, input elements, labels, and the button to the `index.html` file.  The `id` and `for` attributes are used to properly associate labels with their respective input fields.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

*   HTML Forms (`<form>`)
*   Text Input (`<input type="text">`)
*   Password Input (`<input type="password">`)
*   Labels (`<label>`)
*   Buttons (`<button>`)
*   Form Element Attributes (`id`, `for`, `placeholder`, `type`, `action`)
*   Semantic HTML for Forms

## How to Run

1.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The form with the username field, password field, and register button should be displayed.  While the form's `action` attribute is set, submitting the form might not lead to a real page, but the elements and their functionality (like placeholder text) should be visible.
